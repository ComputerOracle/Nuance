// app, not mocks — only the wallet (e2e/mock-wallet.ts) and the LLM
// providers (unset keys -> services/consensus.py's deterministic offline
// heuristic, see e2e/escrow-lifecycle.spec.ts's own docstring) are stood
// in for. A fresh SQLite file per run (E2E_DB_DIR below) keeps this
// completely isolated from both the real dev db and any other e2e run —
