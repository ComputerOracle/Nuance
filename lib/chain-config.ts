// Contract-address wiring — deliberately separate from lib/api.ts's
// NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL (that one always has a working localhost fallback;
// these don't, because there is nothing to fall back to before a real
// contract is deployed and linked — see ROADMAP.md 4.6's SYNC POINT).
//
// Corrected 2026-09-07 (writeContract wiring): the original version of
// this file treated all three contracts as one global NEXT_PUBLIC_*
// address each, "configured" or not for the whole app at once. That's
// only true for NuanceDisputeCourt — a single SHARED REGISTRY (see that
// contract's own header). NuanceEscrow and NuancePredictionMarket are the
// opposite: ONE deployed instance PER escrow / PER market (see
// contracts/nuance_escrow.py and nuance_prediction_market.py, and
// scripts/deploy.ts's own bootstrap-instance caveat) — there is no
// single "the" escrow contract address for the whole app to check
// against. Real per-escrow/per-market addresses come back from the API
// on the row itself (ApiEscrow.contract_address / ApiPrediction.
// contract_address), populated once that row is actually linked to a
// deployed instance — nothing does that yet except services/
// genlayer_indexer.py's --link-demo, which is exactly why every real
// escrow/prediction still routes through the legacy off-chain path today.
//
// Every call site MUST handle `null` — that's the real, current state of
// almost every row in this app, not a hypothetical edge case. Treat a
// null contract address as "route this through the legacy off-chain
// path," exactly like an escrow/dispute created before any cutover.
